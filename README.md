🌙 LuminO AI – Private Personal Chat Assistant

LuminO AI is a fully private, local-first personal chat assistant built using Ollama-powered open-source LLMs.
It allows users to chat with AI models locally, choose which model should answer their questions, and securely store conversation history in MongoDB.

Unlike cloud-based chatbots, LuminO AI keeps your conversations private, customizable, and fully under your control.
